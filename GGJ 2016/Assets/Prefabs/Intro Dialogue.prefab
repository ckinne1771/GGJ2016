  - Ha...I thought it was finally over.
  - '...the laughing...the torment...'
  - I thought that for once I would be able to do something right.
  - I...I thought for once I could have... a little bit of luck
  - But of course things never go right for me.
  - Back in wizard school I was useless
  - '...I wanted to show them that I was'
  - the greatest wixard in the world. The one that is feared by his enemies and loved
    by the ladies.
  - '...but the only companion that'
  - I have had is Liz...my lizard.
  - And this is where everything went wrong.
  - I found a ritual to transform Liz
  - into a mighty dragon.
  - That way I could finally get the fame that I long for and Liz would be big and
    strong as well...at least so I thought.
  - Liz where are you?!
  - Liz!
  - A few minutes later
  - I heard noies from outside.
  - It seems that the ritual caused more problems than I originally thought.
  - It cursed the townsfolk!
  - It turned all the women into old and grumpy Hags!
  - '...by the looks of it they are on their way to my tower...oh no...I need to be
    quick.'
  - I need to find a way of reversing all of this!
  - I need to get Liz back
  - '...after all...she is the only one I have...'
  - except for that stray cat.
